# MarkdownStructureChunker
MarkdownStructureChunker is intelligently chunking documents. The library will parse documents (including markdown and plain text) to identify logical sections based on multiple structural conventions: standard markdown headings (`#`, `##`), numeric/legal outlines (`1.2.4`, `ยง 42`), and appendices (`Appendix A`).
